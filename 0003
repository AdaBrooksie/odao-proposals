- Status: 
- Authors: Brooksie

## Context

OPTIM Finance has done a wonderful job of preventing bots from taking advantage of intitial investors and has been able to develop a substantial liquidity pool using the 5% tax.
This liquidity pool will serve users well going forward.  In terms of the 5% tax it has served its purpose and regular trading fees in line with other pools in the ecosystem should be resumed
as determined by the development team.  This will encourage a larger number of users to take up OPTIM as an investment going forward.

## Proposal

End the 5% tax on OPTIM trades and align the fees with other pools at the discretion of the developers.
The tax should be removed within a 1 week time frame from approval at the discretion of developers.
